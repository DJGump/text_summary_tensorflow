              "'Michigan billionaire education activist Betsy DeVos was confirmed today to serve as the secretary of education in President Trump\\'s administration, after Vice President Mike Pence cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate. The Senate voted on DeVos\"?highly contentious nomination this afternoon, and the tally was split evenly, requiring Pence to use his authority as president of the upper chamber of Congress to break the impasse. This was the first time that a vice president has broken a tie to confirm a Cabinet nominee. Pence read the vote count 50-50 and then voted himself, rendering the tally 51-50. The day before the vote, Democrats staged a 24-hour marathon of speeches, with more than 30 lawmakers taking to the floor to urge at least one additional Republican to vote against DeVos and block her confirmation. \"It is hard to imagine a worse choice,\"?Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before she read letters from constituents urging her to vote no. DeVos stirred up vehement opposition from teachers\"?unions and all 48 Senate Democrats. Many cited concerns about her support of school vouchers, which critics believe will weaken public schools, and her lack of experience, since she never attended or worked in the public education system. Others cited her lack of familiarity with a landmark law protecting the education needs of disabled children.     She was panned for a gaffe during her confirmation hearing, when she hedged on an answer about guns in schools by saying they might be needed in states like Wyoming to defend against \"potential grizzlies.\"?DeVos\\' nomination drew above-average negative reactions from the public, with voters flooding Senate phone lines and email accounts in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said his office received 14,000 calls about DeVos. In addition to the entire Democratic caucus, two moderate Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced they would not support DeVos. During a speech announcing her opposition, Collins said DeVos\"?focus on charters and vouchers \"raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education\\'s primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools.\"?Before the confirmation vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines, 12-11, to refer DeVos\"?nomination to the full Senate.

The source will be passed into the encoder, and the outputs and hidden states are then passed into the decoder. The decoder should then output a token as aprediction. The dictionaries made form the tf Tokenizer function allow the model output to be converted back into text. With some raw python, the token is checked to be a stop token. If it is not and the summary is not the maximum length, the word is appended. The internal states of the decoder and the output token are used as the next input of the decoder, allowing for a non-vanilla recursive tensorflow loop!"

            "Article  east africa should continuously cooperate with developmental financial institutes, known as dfis, to deal with the peak period of debt repayment. countries in the region are dealing with a growing debt burden and will gradually reach the peak period for repayment, due to the major commitment to infrastructure financed by the dfis. one solution is for countries to cooperate with dfis continuously to deal with the repayment issue and convert the burden into an opportunity for growth. benefiting from infusions of external capital, east african countries have seen unprecedented levels of stable economic growth over the last decade. however, as a consequence, the peak period for debt repayment is also arriving. for example, kenya's treasury will have to deploy approximately 40 percent of its tax revenues just to service loans next year. should we view the side-effects of progress in loans as a sign to cut down engagement with dfis? the answer is definitely no. in fact, the current debt situation has already benefited from low interest rates and well-designed repayment models provided by dfis. it's hard to imagine the completion of the expensive mombasa-nairobi standard gauge railway without the support of concessional loans from the export-import bank of china. the modern railway has become a perfect model to leverage the low-cost overseas capital to accelerate domestic construction and foster tremendous opportunities for kenya's national strategy and regional development. meanwhile, dfi loans are often designed to facilitate repayment with grace periods. accordingly, tanzania was firmly rated by the imf as a state with low risk of external debt distress, despite having a high external debt rate of roughly 70 percent. one fact contributing to this is that roughly all the external debt of tanzania remains under dfis, especially multilateral dfis, such as the international developments association and the african development bank. for example, dfi financing assists tanzania considerably in stabilizing its repayment burden and debt distress. with the help of external dfi financing, other often-neglected spillover effects help to foster socioeconomic development. although there is a seemingly inappropriate budget allocation deficiency for education and health in african countries, the robust economic growth and technology transfer will gradually and effectively compensate for social welfare. this so-called share squeezing is temporary, and could be the beginning of new advantages, as some asian countries experienced after world war ii. technology transfer, an increasingly vital principle in any project in africa, will also partially compensate for insufficient investment in education. there is even an argument that the completion of a large-scale project is a graduation ceremony for the local workers involved. however, it is difficult for government leaders to wait for the spillover effects to take effect. that requires time. currently, tanzania's leadership is launching unprecedented campaign to enhance the country's competitive capacity in the form of tax reform. the government plans to collect taxes evaded or underpaid going back 20 years. other than political factors, the tax revenue to be collected is expected to relieve tanzania's repayment burden and dependence on development aid, especially for those with intervention suspicions. the necessity to correct tax evasion should never be denied, but time is needed to examine the results of this ambitious and dangerous campaign. it's obvious that this controversial operation has already offset the state's potential spillover effects. the business environment has been damaged, since the tanzania revenue authority is being urged to collect a fixed amount in a limited time, which leads to unreasonable fines without transparency. large numbers of entrepreneurs, who are not only the pillar of support for the state in this difficult period but also the tunnel for spillover effects, have been driven away or even into bankruptcy. moreover, the government's attitude toward developmental financial engagement should never be packed in the form of nationalism, no matter whether or not the engagement has strings attached. a complete deviation away from external financing will put the country into worse financial condition than ever. the answer to financial difficulties lies in continuous and deeper cooperation with dfis, rather than completely pulling away. further cooperation is the pivot of reversing the vicious cycle of the debt burden. creative use of dfis, such as introducing public and private partnerships, will not only leverage more smart capital and relieve sovereign guarantees, but also improve the state's financial management skills. financial creativity brings more learning opportunities to technocrats than simple lending. new skills will, over time, enhance the state's financial condition from both sides. the author is a master's candidate at sciencespo, paris. the views do not necessarily reflect those of china daily.

13.65 billion euros; 11.63 billion) building two next-generation screen plants in the southwestern province of sichuan in anticipation of future business. talks are at an early stage and it's unlikely to supply the next iphone, but boe is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the source says. timber group teams upwith russia on resources manzhouli lianzhong group, china's largest timber and frame-house building company, is leading a project with russia to develop forest resources. the project, worth more than 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million;

            "Article  a senior u.s. general on wednesday accused russia of deploying a land-based cruise missile in violation of \"the spirit and intent\" of a nuclear arms treaty and charged that moscow's intention is to threaten u.s. facilities in europe and the nato alliance. \"we believe that the russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to nato and to facilities within the nato area of responsibility,\" gen. paul selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a house armed services committee hearing. selva said he sees no indication that moscow intends to return to compliance with the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which bans an entire class of weapons all land-based cruise missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,410 miles). the treaty was a landmark in arms control in the final years of the cold war. selva's accusation takes on added political significance in light of president donald trump's stated goal of improving relations with russia, even as moscow is perceived by u.s. allies in europe as a military threat of growing urgency. the alleged treaty violation comes amid multiple congressional investigations of alleged russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. the fbi also is probing ties between russia and trump associates during the campaign. trump has said little about the inf treaty but on multiple occasions has questioned the value of a separate, more recent treaty that limits the number of strategic nuclear weapons the united states and russia can deploy to 1,550 warheads each, starting in 2018. trump has said it unfairly advantages russia. and he has said the u.s. should expand its nuclear weapons capability, although he has not explained what he meant. even before trump's election, the pentagon was weighing implications of a shift in russian nuclear doctrine that seems to lower the threshold for the combat use of nuclear weapons. the russians have framed their new thinking as \"escalate, to de-escalate,\" meaning possibly using a small number of nuclear weapons to persuade an opponent not to escalate the conflict and possibly lead to all-out nuclear war. \"we have to account for what that means,\" selva said wednesday. \"we've begun an investigation of a series of potential strategy changes,\" he said, in part by conducting war games and military exercises. the obama administration had hoped to talk moscow into returning to compliance with the inf treaty but seemed to make no progress. russia has claimed u.s. missile defenses violate the threat. asked how the u.s. might respond now that russian cruise missiles are deployed for potential use, selva said the military is preparing a set of options to be considered this year by the trump administration as part of a broader nuclear policy review. selva said he could not publicly discuss those options. when pressed he said the plan is to \"look for leverage points to attempt to get the russians to come back into compliance,\" adding, \"i don't know what those leverage points are.\" the obama administration had accused moscow of violating the inf treaty, but selva's statement was the first public confirmation of recent news reports that the russians have deployed the nuclear-capable cruise missile. the new york times, which was first to report the russian missile deployment, said last month that the russians have two battalions now in the field. one is at a missile test site at kapustin yar and one was moved in december from the test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country. russia denies that it has violated the inf treaty. some in congress have expressed alarm at the alleged russian deployment. sen. john mccain, the senate armed services committee chairman, last month called on the trump administration to ensure that u.s. nuclear forces in europe are ready. \"russia's deployment of nuclear-tipped ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the inf treaty is a significant military threat to u.s. forces in europe and our nato allies,\" mccain, r-ariz., said, adding that he believes russian president vladimir putin was \"testing\" trump. in response to questions at the hearing on wednesday, selva said u.s. officials have been talking to moscow about the alleged treaty violation. he seemed unconvinced that the discussions would be fruitful. \"i don't have enough information on their intent to conclude other than they do not intend to return to compliance\" with the treaty, he said. \"absent some pressure from the international community and the united states as a co-signer of the same agreement,\" there is no logical reason to believe that moscow intends to end its violations, he added.\n",

            "Article  sen. richard blumenthal said wednesday that judge neil gorsuch, trump's nominee, told him he found trump's attack on a federal judge on twitter \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" within a half-hour, gorsuch spokesman ron bonjean, who was tapped by the white house to head communications for gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with blumenthal. several other senators, including republican sen. ben sasse of nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of gorsuch forcefully criticizing trump's public attacks on the judiciary branch. supreme court nominee gorsuch calls trump's tweets 'disheartening' and on thursday, blumenthal said on msnbc gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what i said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" but none of that stopped trump from firing off a shot against blumenthal and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the white house's messaging. supreme court nominee gorsuch calls trump's tweets 'disheartening' \"sen. richard blumenthal, who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him?\" trump tweeted thursday morning. gorsuch's criticism came in response to trump's recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban or appear poised to do so, in particular in reference to one of the president's tweets slamming one of those judges as a \"so-called judge.\" \"the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" trump tweeted last saturday. on wednesday, trump pressed forward with his criticism, arguing that the judiciary has become too political and suggesting that judges on the 9th circuit court of appeals might rule against his appeal to reverse a temporary stay on implementing his travel ban because of political considerations, instead of the law. blumenthal stood by his accounting of gorsuch's comments, telling cnn's chris cuomo on \"new day\" thursday morning he \"absolutely and accurately\" stated what gorsuch told him. \"i think that the president needs to hear from judge gorsuch about exactly what he is saying to myself and senate colleagues,\" blumenthal said. \"maybe he simply hasn't been informed and that's the reason for his tweet.\" former gop sen. kelly ayotte, who is helping shepherd gorsuch's nomination on the hill said in a statement thursday gorsuch has told senators \"he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\" ayotte added the judge has made clear he \"could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.\" republican sen. ben sasse of nebraska also confirmed thursday that gorsuch criticized trump's attacks on the federal judge in a meeting with him as well. sasse said gorsuch \"got pretty passionate\" about the topic, particularly when he asked gorsuch about trump's \"so-called judge\" tweet. \"this is a guy who welled up with some energy. he said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. he believes in an an independent judiciary,\" sasse said thursday morning on msnbc. military service trump's dig at blumenthal's military service is a reference to blumenthal's past misrepresentations about his service during the vietnam era. blumenthal obtained multiple military deferments to avoid getting drafted into the vietnam war and ultimately landed in the marine corps reserve and never deployed to vietnam, though he claimed multiple times he had served in vietnam. blumenthal apologized for misrepresenting his service in 2010. while blumenthal enlisted in the marine reserve after multiple deferments, trump who was also eligible for the draft during the vietnam war never enlisted, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft. democrats and gorsuch sen. chris coons said in his personal meeting with gorsuch, he plans to ask the nominee about his commitment to judicial independence given some of the president's recent comments about judges. \"i don't think it's constructive for president trump to weigh in on this and to level accusations against sitting senators,\" the delaware democrat told cnn's alisyn camerota on \"new day.\" \"i frankly think the more he stays out of this the better for his judicial nominee.\" \"but this simply highlights why judicial independence is going to be so important for me and for other senators as we go through the process of meeting judge gorsuch and considering whether or not he should serve on the supreme court,\" he added. trump's thursday tweet could complicate the upcoming hearings for gorsuch, who is certain to face questions about trump's

            "Article  russian opposition leader alexei navalny has been sentenced to 15 days in prison after being detained at a major opposition protest that he had organised. a moscow court issued the verdict on monday against navalny for resisting police orders on sunday when he walked to the protest in the russian capital. navalny, 40, posted a selfie on twitter from the courtroom, saying: \"a time will come when we'll put them on trial too - and that time it will be fair.\" \"even the slightest illusion of fair justice is absent here,\" navalny said on monday at the defendant's bench, complaining about the judge striking down one motion after another. \"yesterday's events have shown that quite a large number of voters in russia support the program of a candidate who stands for fighting corruption. these people demand political representation - and i strive to be their political representative.\" tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across russia on sunday in the biggest show of defiance since the 2011-2012 anti-government protests. profile: alexei navalny, thorn in putin's side the kremlin has dismissed the opposition as a westernised urban elite disconnected from the issues faced by the poor in russia's far-flung regions. but sunday's protests included demonstrations in the areas which typically produce a high vote for president- vladimir putin,-from siberia's chita to dagestan's makhachkala. putin's spokesman on monday criticised the organisers for allegedly inciting illegal acts. \"the kremlin respects people's civic stance and their right to voice their position,\" said putin spokesman dmitry peskov. \"we can't express the same respect to those who consciously misled people and who consciously did it yesterday and provoked illegal actions.\" peskov defended the russian police in riot gear who were seen manhandling protesters, some of whom were minors, calling their response \"highly professional and lawful\". asked about the kremlin's reaction to the wide geography of the protests, something that has not been seen at least since 2012, peskov said \"the kremlin is quite sober about the scale of yesterday's protests, and are not inclined to diminish them or push them out of proportion\". putin \"constantly talks to people\" and is well-briefed on the sentiment in the country, peskov insisted. peskov also claimed that underage protesters in moscow were promised cash if they were arrested. the council of europe said the detentions of the protesters raised concerns about freedom of expression and assembly. russian authorities should release all those detained, secretary general thorbjorn jagland said. the european union and the united states also condemned the detentions. german government spokesman steffen seibert said freedom of assembly, which is \"of great importance to democracy,\" was being tested in russia. opinion: under surveillance in russia the resignation of prime minister dmitry medvedev was the main demand of sunday's protests that were called for by navalny after he published a detailed report this month accusing him of controlling a property empire through a shadowy network of non-profit organisations. medvedev, who has so far made no comments on the claims, is accused of amassing a private collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards. the alleged luxuries include a house for raising ducks, thus many placards in the protests showed mocking images of a yellow toy duck. al jazeera's rory challands, reporting from russia, said that the breadth and scale of sunday's protests had likely surprised both navalny and the kremlin; solidifying navalny's position as the pre-eminent opposition voice. \"navalny's message of anti-corruption has really struck a chord with russians,\" said challands. \"and going after dmitry medvedev, the prime minister, is pretty canny because - although putin at the top of the tree is fairly unassailable - dmitry medvedev is a different political animal. he is much more vulnerable, much less popular, and putting pressure on him puts pressure on vladimir putin.\" source:-al jazeera and news agencies\n",

            "Article  trump has since named ret. lt. gen. joseph keith kellogg, who worked under flynn until the latter was asked to resign, as the acting national security adviser. asked if there was a candidate for national security adviser in sight, a white house official told cnn, \"not that i'm aware of.\" \"since retiring, i have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position,\" harward said in a statement. \"like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, 7 days a week focus and commitment to do it right. i currently could not make that commitment. my thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country's national security concerns. god bless this great country of ours.\" a friend of harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the white house seems so chaotic. harward called the offer a \"s*** sandwich,\" the friend said. a republican official told cnn that harward made it a condition of taking the job that he could form his own team. in the end, he didn't feel that was the case. and a senior republican familiar with the process added that \"a question of clarity regarding the lines of authority\" was central in harward's decision. \"i wouldn't call it a disagreement as much as questions that could not be resolved to his comfort level,\" the senior republican said. harward served as mattis's deputy when he was commander of us central command, which oversees us military operations in iraq and afghanistan. flynn was forced to resign his position in the trump administration after reports said he discussed sanctions with the russian ambassador before trump was inaugurated and misled vice president mike pence about the conversation. the white house said flynn's omission about the details of his conversation led to an erosion of trust between flynn and the president, prompting flynn's exit. following a more than 30-year military career, harward became chief executive of defense giant lockheed martin's united arab emirates division. harward was already familiar with the role of national security adviser and the work of the national security council, having previously worked on the nsc's counterterrorism office from 2003 to 2005 during president george w. bush's administration. after flynn's resignation, harward's name floated to the top of lists for potential replacements, alongside acting adviser kellogg and retired army gen. david petraeus, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to mishandling classified information after he shared sensitive material with a woman with whom he was having an affair. ret. army maj. gen. james \"spider\" marks, a cnn military analyst, called harward an \"incredibly talented guy\" in an interview with cnn's erin burnett on \"outfront. marks said he didn't want to speculate why harward turned down the job, but said turmoil in the white house was likely a contributing factor. \"i'm sure bob looked at this, adm. harward looked at this, and said, 'look there's a lot of forming and storming going on right now.'\" but sen. james lankford, r-oklahoma, dismissed suggestions that white house chaos led to harward's decision to not accept the role, calling it \"hearsay.\" \"am i surprised, 72 hours after flynn resigns, that we're still in the process of doing a turn for that? no, i'm not,\" he told burnett.\n",

        "This model aims to solve what the first is bad at: handling long inputs. The encoder/decoder really only makes use of the end of the source article, and the preceding target word. The attention layer (ideally) emphasizes parts of the source most related to the target. This is a custom layer I found with these architectures. However to save and load the model, I had to add a config method to the Attention Layer object. One of my biggest take aways from this project is how flexible tensorflow can be."

            "Article  east africa should continuously cooperate with developmental financial institutes, known as dfis, to deal with the peak period of debt repayment. countries in the region are dealing with a growing debt burden and will gradually reach the peak period for repayment, due to the major commitment to infrastructure financed by the dfis. one solution is for countries to cooperate with dfis continuously to deal with the repayment issue and convert the burden into an opportunity for growth. benefiting from infusions of external capital, east african countries have seen unprecedented levels of stable economic growth over the last decade. however, as a consequence, the peak period for debt repayment is also arriving. for example, kenya's treasury will have to deploy approximately 40 percent of its tax revenues just to service loans next year. should we view the side-effects of progress in loans as a sign to cut down engagement with dfis? the answer is definitely no. in fact, the current debt situation has already benefited from low interest rates and well-designed repayment models provided by dfis. it's hard to imagine the completion of the expensive mombasa-nairobi standard gauge railway without the support of concessional loans from the export-import bank of china. the modern railway has become a perfect model to leverage the low-cost overseas capital to accelerate domestic construction and foster tremendous opportunities for kenya's national strategy and regional development. meanwhile, dfi loans are often designed to facilitate repayment with grace periods. accordingly, tanzania was firmly rated by the imf as a state with low risk of external debt distress, despite having a high external debt rate of roughly 70 percent. one fact contributing to this is that roughly all the external debt of tanzania remains under dfis, especially multilateral dfis, such as the international developments association and the african development bank. for example, dfi financing assists tanzania considerably in stabilizing its repayment burden and debt distress. with the help of external dfi financing, other often-neglected spillover effects help to foster socioeconomic development. although there is a seemingly inappropriate budget allocation deficiency for education and health in african countries, the robust economic growth and technology transfer will gradually and effectively compensate for social welfare. this so-called share squeezing is temporary, and could be the beginning of new advantages, as some asian countries experienced after world war ii. technology transfer, an increasingly vital principle in any project in africa, will also partially compensate for insufficient investment in education. there is even an argument that the completion of a large-scale project is a graduation ceremony for the local workers involved. however, it is difficult for government leaders to wait for the spillover effects to take effect. that requires time. currently, tanzania's leadership is launching unprecedented campaign to enhance the country's competitive capacity in the form of tax reform. the government plans to collect taxes evaded or underpaid going back 20 years. other than political factors, the tax revenue to be collected is expected to relieve tanzania's repayment burden and dependence on development aid, especially for those with intervention suspicions. the necessity to correct tax evasion should never be denied, but time is needed to examine the results of this ambitious and dangerous campaign. it's obvious that this controversial operation has already offset the state's potential spillover effects. the business environment has been damaged, since the tanzania revenue authority is being urged to collect a fixed amount in a limited time, which leads to unreasonable fines without transparency. large numbers of entrepreneurs, who are not only the pillar of support for the state in this difficult period but also the tunnel for spillover effects, have been driven away or even into bankruptcy. moreover, the government's attitude toward developmental financial engagement should never be packed in the form of nationalism, no matter whether or not the engagement has strings attached. a complete deviation away from external financing will put the country into worse financial condition than ever. the answer to financial difficulties lies in continuous and deeper cooperation with dfis, rather than completely pulling away. further cooperation is the pivot of reversing the vicious cycle of the debt burden. creative use of dfis, such as introducing public and private partnerships, will not only leverage more smart capital and relieve sovereign guarantees, but also improve the state's financial management skills. financial creativity brings more learning opportunities to technocrats than simple lending. new skills will, over time, enhance the state's financial condition from both sides. the author is a master's candidate at sciencespo, paris. the views do not necessarily reflect those of china daily.

13.65 billion euros; 11.63 billion) building two next-generation screen plants in the southwestern province of sichuan in anticipation of future business. talks are at an early stage and it's unlikely to supply the next iphone, but boe is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the source says. timber group teams upwith russia on resources manzhouli lianzhong group, china's largest timber and frame-house building company, is leading a project with russia to develop forest resources. the project, worth more than 1.5 billion yuan ($218 million;

            "Article  a senior u.s. general on wednesday accused russia of deploying a land-based cruise missile in violation of \"the spirit and intent\" of a nuclear arms treaty and charged that moscow's intention is to threaten u.s. facilities in europe and the nato alliance. \"we believe that the russians have deliberately deployed it in order to pose a threat to nato and to facilities within the nato area of responsibility,\" gen. paul selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told a house armed services committee hearing. selva said he sees no indication that moscow intends to return to compliance with the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, which bans an entire class of weapons all land-based cruise missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (310 and 3,410 miles). the treaty was a landmark in arms control in the final years of the cold war. selva's accusation takes on added political significance in light of president donald trump's stated goal of improving relations with russia, even as moscow is perceived by u.s. allies in europe as a military threat of growing urgency. the alleged treaty violation comes amid multiple congressional investigations of alleged russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. the fbi also is probing ties between russia and trump associates during the campaign. trump has said little about the inf treaty but on multiple occasions has questioned the value of a separate, more recent treaty that limits the number of strategic nuclear weapons the united states and russia can deploy to 1,550 warheads each, starting in 2018. trump has said it unfairly advantages russia. and he has said the u.s. should expand its nuclear weapons capability, although he has not explained what he meant. even before trump's election, the pentagon was weighing implications of a shift in russian nuclear doctrine that seems to lower the threshold for the combat use of nuclear weapons. the russians have framed their new thinking as \"escalate, to de-escalate,\" meaning possibly using a small number of nuclear weapons to persuade an opponent not to escalate the conflict and possibly lead to all-out nuclear war. \"we have to account for what that means,\" selva said wednesday. \"we've begun an investigation of a series of potential strategy changes,\" he said, in part by conducting war games and military exercises. the obama administration had hoped to talk moscow into returning to compliance with the inf treaty but seemed to make no progress. russia has claimed u.s. missile defenses violate the threat. asked how the u.s. might respond now that russian cruise missiles are deployed for potential use, selva said the military is preparing a set of options to be considered this year by the trump administration as part of a broader nuclear policy review. selva said he could not publicly discuss those options. when pressed he said the plan is to \"look for leverage points to attempt to get the russians to come back into compliance,\" adding, \"i don't know what those leverage points are.\" the obama administration had accused moscow of violating the inf treaty, but selva's statement was the first public confirmation of recent news reports that the russians have deployed the nuclear-capable cruise missile. the new york times, which was first to report the russian missile deployment, said last month that the russians have two battalions now in the field. one is at a missile test site at kapustin yar and one was moved in december from the test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country. russia denies that it has violated the inf treaty. some in congress have expressed alarm at the alleged russian deployment. sen. john mccain, the senate armed services committee chairman, last month called on the trump administration to ensure that u.s. nuclear forces in europe are ready. \"russia's deployment of nuclear-tipped ground-launched cruise missiles in violation of the inf treaty is a significant military threat to u.s. forces in europe and our nato allies,\" mccain, r-ariz., said, adding that he believes russian president vladimir putin was \"testing\" trump. in response to questions at the hearing on wednesday, selva said u.s. officials have been talking to moscow about the alleged treaty violation. he seemed unconvinced that the discussions would be fruitful. \"i don't have enough information on their intent to conclude other than they do not intend to return to compliance\" with the treaty, he said. \"absent some pressure from the international community and the united states as a co-signer of the same agreement,\" there is no logical reason to believe that moscow intends to end its violations, he added.\n",

            "Article  sen. richard blumenthal said wednesday that judge neil gorsuch, trump's nominee, told him he found trump's attack on a federal judge on twitter \"disheartening\" and \"demoralizing.\" within a half-hour, gorsuch spokesman ron bonjean, who was tapped by the white house to head communications for gorsuch, confirmed that the nominee, gorsuch, used those words in his meeting with blumenthal. several other senators, including republican sen. ben sasse of nebraska, later relayed similar accounts of gorsuch forcefully criticizing trump's public attacks on the judiciary branch. supreme court nominee gorsuch calls trump's tweets 'disheartening' and on thursday, blumenthal said on msnbc gorsuch specifically told him he \"should feel free to mention what i said about these attacks being disheartening and demoralizing.\" but none of that stopped trump from firing off a shot against blumenthal and at the same time raising questions about the coherence of the white house's messaging. supreme court nominee gorsuch calls trump's tweets 'disheartening' \"sen. richard blumenthal, who never fought in vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what judge gorsuch told him?\" trump tweeted thursday morning. gorsuch's criticism came in response to trump's recent criticism of federal judges who have ruled against his immigration ban or appear poised to do so, in particular in reference to one of the president's tweets slamming one of those judges as a \"so-called judge.\" \"the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" trump tweeted last saturday. on wednesday, trump pressed forward with his criticism, arguing that the judiciary has become too political and suggesting that judges on the 9th circuit court of appeals might rule against his appeal to reverse a temporary stay on implementing his travel ban because of political considerations, instead of the law. blumenthal stood by his accounting of gorsuch's comments, telling cnn's chris cuomo on \"new day\" thursday morning he \"absolutely and accurately\" stated what gorsuch told him. \"i think that the president needs to hear from judge gorsuch about exactly what he is saying to myself and senate colleagues,\" blumenthal said. \"maybe he simply hasn't been informed and that's the reason for his tweet.\" former gop sen. kelly ayotte, who is helping shepherd gorsuch's nomination on the hill said in a statement thursday gorsuch has told senators \"he finds any criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.\" ayotte added the judge has made clear he \"could not comment on any specific cases and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.\" republican sen. ben sasse of nebraska also confirmed thursday that gorsuch criticized trump's attacks on the federal judge in a meeting with him as well. sasse said gorsuch \"got pretty passionate\" about the topic, particularly when he asked gorsuch about trump's \"so-called judge\" tweet. \"this is a guy who welled up with some energy. he said any attack on any brothers or sisters of the robe is an attack on all judges. he believes in an an independent judiciary,\" sasse said thursday morning on msnbc. military service trump's dig at blumenthal's military service is a reference to blumenthal's past misrepresentations about his service during the vietnam era. blumenthal obtained multiple military deferments to avoid getting drafted into the vietnam war and ultimately landed in the marine corps reserve and never deployed to vietnam, though he claimed multiple times he had served in vietnam. blumenthal apologized for misrepresenting his service in 2010. while blumenthal enlisted in the marine reserve after multiple deferments, trump who was also eligible for the draft during the vietnam war never enlisted, instead obtaining multiple student deferments and ultimately a medical deferment for a bone spur to avoid the military draft. democrats and gorsuch sen. chris coons said in his personal meeting with gorsuch, he plans to ask the nominee about his commitment to judicial independence given some of the president's recent comments about judges. \"i don't think it's constructive for president trump to weigh in on this and to level accusations against sitting senators,\" the delaware democrat told cnn's alisyn camerota on \"new day.\" \"i frankly think the more he stays out of this the better for his judicial nominee.\" \"but this simply highlights why judicial independence is going to be so important for me and for other senators as we go through the process of meeting judge gorsuch and considering whether or not he should serve on the supreme court,\" he added. trump's thursday tweet could complicate the upcoming hearings for gorsuch, who is certain to face questions about trump's tweets from democrats. liberals, already concerned with gorsuch's record, have also asked how he will demonstrate independence from the president. the president is also set to meet with red state democrats for lunch, in hopes of wooing their support for gorsuch. cnn's ashley killough, jeff zeleny and eugene scott contributed to this report.\n",

            "Article  russian opposition leader alexei navalny has been sentenced to 15 days in prison after being detained at a major opposition protest that he had organised. a moscow court issued the verdict on monday against navalny for resisting police orders on sunday when he walked to the protest in the russian capital. navalny, 40, posted a selfie on twitter from the courtroom, saying: \"a time will come when we'll put them on trial too - and that time it will be fair.\" \"even the slightest illusion of fair justice is absent here,\" navalny said on monday at the defendant's bench, complaining about the judge striking down one motion after another. \"yesterday's events have shown that quite a large number of voters in russia support the program of a candidate who stands for fighting corruption. these people demand political representation - and i strive to be their political representative.\" tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across russia on sunday in the biggest show of defiance since the 2011-2012 anti-government protests. profile: alexei navalny, thorn in putin's side the kremlin has dismissed the opposition as a westernised urban elite disconnected from the issues faced by the poor in russia's far-flung regions. but sunday's protests included demonstrations in the areas which typically produce a high vote for president- vladimir putin,-from siberia's chita to dagestan's makhachkala. putin's spokesman on monday criticised the organisers for allegedly inciting illegal acts. \"the kremlin respects people's civic stance and their right to voice their position,\" said putin spokesman dmitry peskov. \"we can't express the same respect to those who consciously misled people and who consciously did it yesterday and provoked illegal actions.\" peskov defended the russian police in riot gear who were seen manhandling protesters, some of whom were minors, calling their response \"highly professional and lawful\". asked about the kremlin's reaction to the wide geography of the protests, something that has not been seen at least since 2012, peskov said \"the kremlin is quite sober about the scale of yesterday's protests, and are not inclined to diminish them or push them out of proportion\". putin \"constantly talks to people\" and is well-briefed on the sentiment in the country, peskov insisted. peskov also claimed that underage protesters in moscow were promised cash if they were arrested. the council of europe said the detentions of the protesters raised concerns about freedom of expression and assembly. russian authorities should release all those detained, secretary general thorbjorn jagland said. the european union and the united states also condemned the detentions. german government spokesman steffen seibert said freedom of assembly, which is \"of great importance to democracy,\" was being tested in russia. opinion: under surveillance in russia the resignation of prime minister dmitry medvedev was the main demand of sunday's protests that were called for by navalny after he published a detailed report this month accusing him of controlling a property empire through a shadowy network of non-profit organisations. medvedev, who has so far made no comments on the claims, is accused of amassing a private collection of mansions, yachts and vineyards. the alleged luxuries include a house for raising ducks, thus many placards in the protests showed mocking images of a yellow toy duck. al jazeera's rory challands, reporting from russia, said that the breadth and scale of sunday's protests had likely surprised both navalny and the kremlin; solidifying navalny's position as the pre-eminent opposition voice. \"navalny's message of anti-corruption has really struck a chord with russians,\" said challands. \"and going after dmitry medvedev, the prime minister, is pretty canny because - although putin at the top of the tree is fairly unassailable - dmitry medvedev is a different political animal. he is much more vulnerable, much less popular, and putting pressure on him puts pressure on vladimir putin.\" source:-al jazeera and news agencies\n",

            "Article  trump has since named ret. lt. gen. joseph keith kellogg, who worked under flynn until the latter was asked to resign, as the acting national security adviser. asked if there was a candidate for national security adviser in sight, a white house official told cnn, \"not that i'm aware of.\" \"since retiring, i have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position,\" harward said in a statement. \"like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, 7 days a week focus and commitment to do it right. i currently could not make that commitment. my thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country's national security concerns. god bless this great country of ours.\" a friend of harward's said he was reluctant to take the job because the white house seems so chaotic. harward called the offer a \"s*** sandwich,\" the friend said. a republican official told cnn that harward made it a condition of taking the job that he could form his own team. in the end, he didn't feel that was the case. and a senior republican familiar with the process added that \"a question of clarity regarding the lines of authority\" was central in harward's decision. \"i wouldn't call it a disagreement as much as questions that could not be resolved to his comfort level,\" the senior republican said. harward served as mattis's deputy when he was commander of us central command, which oversees us military operations in iraq and afghanistan. flynn was forced to resign his position in the trump administration after reports said he discussed sanctions with the russian ambassador before trump was inaugurated and misled vice president mike pence about the conversation. the white house said flynn's omission about the details of his conversation led to an erosion of trust between flynn and the president, prompting flynn's exit. following a more than 30-year military career, harward became chief executive of defense giant lockheed martin's united arab emirates division. harward was already familiar with the role of national security adviser and the work of the national security council, having previously worked on the nsc's counterterrorism office from 2003 to 2005 during president george w. bush's administration. after flynn's resignation, harward's name floated to the top of lists for potential replacements, alongside acting adviser kellogg and retired army gen. david petraeus, who pleaded guilty in 2015 to mishandling classified information after he shared sensitive material with a woman with whom he was having an affair. ret. army maj. gen. james \"spider\" marks, a cnn military analyst, called harward an \"incredibly talented guy\" in an interview with cnn's erin burnett on \"outfront. marks said he didn't want to speculate why harward turned down the job, but said turmoil in the white house was likely a contributing factor. \"i'm sure bob looked at this, adm. harward looked at this, and said, 'look there's a lot of forming and storming going on right now.'\" but sen. james lankford, r-oklahoma, dismissed suggestions that white house chaos led to harward's decision to not accept the role, calling it \"hearsay.\" \"am i surprised, 72 hours after flynn resigns, that we're still in the process of doing a turn for that? no, i'm not,\" he told burnett.\n",

        "### Results Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "  First, even getting these models to run was a victory in itself. Besides some reference material over simplifying the architectures, the models were incredibly demanding in terms of memory. The first model would throw Out of Memory errors with the whole training data until I upgraded to Colab Pro and switched to a TPU (tensor processing unit, specifically designed for a task like this). Once I established that worked, I implemented the attention layer and was met with outright notebook crashes. I eventually identified batch size as the culprit. My best guess is with the input articles being so long, the pre-allocated tensors were enormous. Reducing the batch size allowed me to fit the attention layer model, but it took several hours each for the two training sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  With both models, the same summary is generated regardless of test input. This is.. strange, and undesirable. I have a few hypotheses on what could be causing this. First, the models may have learned the vocabularies, but not how to interpret the source text. Training weights may be what is determining these homogeneous predictions. There may also be a bug with loading the model and re-declaring  layers for inference. I have asusmed weights are applied to the layer instances, but the declarations in the inference could be ending up untrained. I thin kthis is less likely since I notice systemic differences in the predictions of the two models, however this could just be due to the presence of the attention layer evem if it is incorrectly trianed because of the model loading. Lasltly, predicitions are different every restart/run all. I am pretty sure this stochasticity is a combination of the tokenization function and the trainable embedding layer. Word tokens are different every run, and due to the small data set, the embedding has a high degree of variability in learning. Laslty, both summaries are of the full target length. This means a \"stop\" token is never generrated. This is another clue that the models are only learning the vocabularies. I will discuss how to overcome these obstacles below. \n",
        "\n",
        "  With the first model, it really only learns from the end of the source and immediately preceding target word. I notice more stop words, and longer sequences of more common words. \n",
        "\n",
        "The second model seems to have more nouns and shorter sequences of single-word repetition. This should be expected if the attention layer is working as expexted, as stopwords will have less relevance to the target.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The above observations are somewhat of a stretch given al lthat could be improved. However, one consistent, logical, and obvious feature stands out: the ends of the summaries. In both models, the farther in the summary, the more removed from conext the predictions become. In the simple encoder/decoder model, it's heavy reliance on the preceding word is made apparent by it devolving into one or two common words such as \" were was was were was was were was was was were was was were...\". The attention model, however, devolves into a much more diverse set of less common words (albeit with some repition): \"campaign city white three state what made said united more united more group that to to up about about executive executive administration administration our i united administration administration our\". This demonstrates there is a difference in how the models have learned, and it aligns with the attention mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps and Improvements\n",
        "  Obviously, the current output is not useful. Changing the data is always the best place to start. Using more datato train would be a great first step. Training on an automatic, text-rank summaries is not ideal. Human made summaries would be better training targets, so the models can be exposed to true abstractive summarization. Having shorter source articles should increase performance as well, so more relevant information is retained by the recurrent layers and attention mechanism. \n",
        "  \n",
        " Counter to this, adding to the model more recurrent layers could aid in retaining more distant source states. Different or modified attention layers are also an avenue of exploration. The embedding layer is currently as vanilla as possible, and introduces a great deal of variability with training. There might also be some issue with the tokenizer changing encoding each restart, and the embedding being trained on a previous encoding. Tensorflow is unclear on the randomness of the Tokenize function, and testing by retraining would push days worth of hours. This also would not explain why the same predicition is being made for every test value. Pretrained embeddings, such as BERT, tokenize and preprocess autromatically. Not only should transferred embeddings represent word meanings better, they may also solve the tokenization problem. Lastly, some of my assumptions about tensorflow may be wrong. I have not been able to find a clear answer on the ramifications of loading the model, then instantiating new models from it for inference. Having more computing power would also make my life much, much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Uses and Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "With what I have demonstrated, I believe it is possible to take long pieces of text, and abstract the main ideas out. There are two main audiences of this tool. First are editors for periodicals and news sources. News articles tend to have the most relevant information in the beginning, and many sites have existing summaries and headlines. This existing data could be used to train the model, and then summaries could be automatically generated. This would save editors and writers time. This application could also service news aggregation services or blog hosting services. Having a blurb be automatically generated for mobile notifications could drive usage for services where the provider is not necessarily directly working with the writers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, this model could be implemented on online retail reviews. Many reviews already have the format of Long review with a few words summary, and of course a start rating. This is the perfect format to feed into this abstractive model. This could allow retailers to create standardized dropdowns for review summaries. Abstractive summaries should distill broad ideas and sentiments out of more specific text, and can be tied to other statistics such as usability, accuracy and satisfaction of what is being bought. \n",
        "\n",
        "In general, I believe with the right data this summarization model can automate common publication tasks, and provide insight on what users type. "
